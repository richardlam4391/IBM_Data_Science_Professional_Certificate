# Python Project for Data Science
## Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

---

**Completed:** April 2025 | **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**

## 📊 Course Overview

This project serves as the final capstone element for the **Python Project for Data Science** mini-course, a key module within the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**. In this project, I assumed the role of a Data Analyst / Data Scientist tasked with extracting essential financial data from public companies (specifically Tesla and GameStop) to analyze performance trends. The project demonstrates a complete programmatic pipeline: gathering stock data using libraries, web scraping historical revenue records, processing text into clean data frames, and building a consolidated visual dashboard to compare price movements against financial revenue trends.

## 🎯 Key Findings

* **Tesla (TSLA):** Historical stock trends reveal massive, exponential valuation growth starting around 2020. This trajectory closely mimics the aggressive, multi-billion dollar upward trend seen in their parsed revenue metrics, showcasing a strong correlation between operational scaling and market capitalization.
* **GameStop (GME):** The data captures the historical early-2021 volatility spike driven by retail trading dynamics. The visualization highlights a distinct divergence during this period, where stock prices surged exponentially without an equivalent underlying spike in quarterly company revenue.
* **Data Synthesis:** Combining raw automated APIs with unstructured web scraped tables proves critical. Looking at stock graphs alone misses fundamental fiscal context; overlaying revenue graphs helps rapidly distinguish organic long-term growth from sudden market anomalies.

## 📊 Data Sources

This project leverages two primary data streams to analyze financial performance for [Tesla (TSLA)](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue) and [GameStop (GME)](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/revenue):
* **Stock Market Data:** Retrieved programmatically using the official `yfinance` (Yahoo Finance) API to stream historical performance metrics, including Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.
* **Historical Financials:** Extracted via web scraping from Macrotrends to capture quarterly revenue disclosures spanning multiple fiscal years.

## 💡 Key Skills Demonstrated

* **API Integration** - Using specialized financial libraries (yfinance) to query complex ticker data seamlessly.
* **Web Scraping & DOM Parsing** - Constructing programmatic HTTP requests, bypassing basic scraping barriers, and navigating HTML tree structures with BeautifulSoup to find hidden table nodes.
* **Data Preprocessing & Wrangling** - Parsing string values containing currency characters ($) and punctuation (commas), handling missing data rows, and converting target vectors into optimized numeric and datetime types.
* **Interactive Dashboard Development** - Designing a robust helper function using Plotly to output dual-graph interactive dashboards with slider filters.

## 📈 Visualization Highlights

* **Historical Share Price Chart** - A clean, time-series line plot tracking closing values across the company's lifespan.
* **Historical Revenue Chart** - A matching timeline bar or line chart tracking actual revenue figures side-by-side.
